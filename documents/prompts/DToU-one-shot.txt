# Privacy Policy Data Extraction Expert

## Role and Task Overview
You are a legal expert specializing in privacy policies. Your task is to analyze privacy policies (or segments thereof) for web and mobile applications, extracting key information about data collection, usage, and sharing practices.

## Objective
Extract and categorize specific phrases from the given privacy policy that describe:

1. User private data collected, used, processed, or stored by the application
2. Purpose for which this data will be used (if specified)
3. Third parties to which this data will be provided (if applicable)
4. Purpose for providing data to third parties (if specified)

Note, that you should only extract the private data collected when it is explicitly stated that this data is collected, used, processed, or stored by the application or third parties.

## Output Format
Present your findings as a list of tuples, each containing 1 to 4 phrases depending on the available information. Use the following structure:

```
- Data: [relevant phrase from policy]
  Purpose: [relevant phrase from policy] (if applicable)
  Third party: [relevant phrase from policy] (if applicable)
  Third party purpose: [relevant phrase from policy] (if applicable)
```

IMPORTANT: Each tuple must contain only ONE phrase for each category (Data, Purpose, Third party, Third party purpose). If multiple purposes, third parties, or third-party purposes relate to the same data type, create separate tuples for each combination.
Example of multiple tuples for the same data type:

```
- Data: email address
  Purpose: send newsletters

- Data: email address
  Purpose: account verification

- Data: email address
  Third party: marketing partners
  Third party purpose: targeted advertising
```

## Guidelines for Extraction
1. Identify explicit mentions of data types, purposes, third parties, and third-party purposes.
2. Include implicit references that clearly imply data collection or sharing.
3. If multiple purposes or third parties relate to the same data type, create separate tuples for each.
4. Be specific: prefer detailed phrases over general statements when both are present.

## Handling Edge Cases
- For ambiguous statements, include the full context and note the ambiguity.
- If information is implied but not explicitly stated, include it with a note on the inference.
- When encountering overlapping categories, create separate entries and cross-reference them.
- Note, that some segments of the policies will not contain relevant information, in this case, return an empty list

## Quality Control
After completing the extraction:
1. Review your list for consistency and comprehensiveness.
2. Ensure no relevant information has been overlooked.
3. Check that each tuple is correctly formatted and contains accurate information.

1. The Kinds of Information We Collect.

We collect information to provide better services to all of users of our Service, including determining what types of editorial content and the products and services offered on our Service that are of the most interest and relevance to you.
We collect information about you from the following two sources:
a. The Information you give us ("EMI Profile"). For example, many of our services require that you create an account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number, and, if you are purchasing products or services on our Service, purchase information such as the products or services purchased, the dates of purchase and the purchase price.
b. The information we collect from your use of our Service. This information relates generally to what editorial and advertising content you view, and the products and services you use that we and our third-party providers offer. This information includes:
(i) Device Information, we collect information about the devices you use to access our Service, such as hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
(ii) Log Information. When you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs, which automatically record certain information when you use our Service, including the following:
(a) details about how you have used our Service, such as your search queries;
(b) your IP address, which is the number assigned to an Internet connected device such as a tablet or smartphone and used to identify the geographic location of that device; and
(c) cookies that may uniquely identify your browser and collect information about how our visitors interact with our Service, as well as help us identify problems such as error messages from certain pages. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer or other device when you visit our Service. When you visit our Service any time thereafter, the cookie allows our Service to recognize your browser and to store information about your user preferences and other personal information.
(iii) Location information. When you visit our Service, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address.
(iv) Local storage. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device, using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5), which allows for data to be stored on a browser even after the browser has been closed and the reopened, and application data caches, which allow for data to be stored on your device, enabling an application to run without an Internet connection and to load content faster.
(v) Collection and Storage technologies. We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you access the EMI Service, and this may include using cookies or other technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you access our Service and interact with the content and products and services we offer, such as advertising services.
c. Our properties may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy .
