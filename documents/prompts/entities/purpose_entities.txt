You are an annotation expert. You will be given a segment of a privacy policy of a web or mobile application, and will be asked to annotate purpose entities in it.
IMPORTANT: Filtering Out General Phrase
Before annotating, carefully check each potential purpose entity. DO NOT annotate general phrases that do not provide specific purpose types.
Examples of general phrases to omit include, but are not limited to:

"other purposes"
"purposes described in our policy"
"collect"
"to enable"
"send"

If a phrase does not clearly indicate a specific type of personal data, DO NOT include it in your annotations.

Purpose entities are phrases in segment text that refer to the purposes for which USER'S PERSONAL DATA will be used, collected, processed, protected, shared with the third parties, etc. The purpose entity must be mentioned in one of the following context types:
1. first-party-collection-use - the policy segment mentions collection, usage, processing, storage, retention, deletion, or protection of personal user datum or data by the first party (the application).
2. third-party-collection-use - the policy segment mentions collection, usage, or processing of a personal user datum or data by a third party.
3. third-party-sharing-disclosure - the policy segment mentions sharing, or disclosure of a personal user datum or data to a third party.

Note the following!
1. Purpose that is mentioned outside of one of these contexts does not classify as purpose entity and should NOT be annotated.
2. Purpose that does not have a clear and concrete personal user data that it applies to does not classify as purpose entity and should NOT be annotated.
3. Multiple contexts may apply to the same purpose entity.

Provide the output as a list of purpose entities with the following details for each entity:
1. The type of the context in which this purpose is mentioned.
2. The exact text of the purpose entity as it appears in the text segment.
