For reference, the previously annotated entities are of the following types:
1. Data - refers to the phrases that mention personal data of the user, that is being collected, used, stored, processed, protected, shared with third parties etc. This does not include personal data is its simply mentioned, but there is no mention of action done with it by the application.
