Data safeguards and privacy

All uses of Web-based technologies comply with existing privacy and data safeguarding policies and standards. Information Technology (IT) systems owned and operated by CMS are assessed using Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) posted for public view on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) website ( http://www.hhs.gov/pia ). CMS conducts and publishes a PIA for each use of a third-party website and application (TPWA) as they may have a different functionality or practice. TPWA PIAs are posted for public view on the HHS website at http://www.hhs.gov/pia .
Groups of records that contain information about an individual and are designed to be retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier linked to the individual are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a). For these records, CMS Systems of Record Notices are published in the Federal Register and posted on the CMS Senior Official for Privacy Website.
