International Transfers

We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. When we share information of EU and EEA users outside the EU or EEA, we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. For internal transfers, we rely on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.
