Right of access

You have a right to know what information we hold about you and in some cases to have the information communicated to you. If you wish to exercise this right please contact us letting us know that you wish to exercise your right of access and what information in particular you would like to receive. We reserve the right to ask for reasonable evidence to verify your identity before we provide you with any information, and the law permits us to charge a fee for exercising this right of access. Where we are not able to provide you with information that you have asked for, we will endeavour to tell you why. We will try to respond to any request within a reasonable timeframe
