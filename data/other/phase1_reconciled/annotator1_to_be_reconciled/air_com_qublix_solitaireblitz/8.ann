#1	AnnotatorNotes T37	Could be a third party?
#2	AnnotatorNotes T18	I realise that condition primarily relates to conditions for users; however, this is a condition on behalf of the first party user, rather than a purpose (i.e., information is released if it is permitted by law). The same holds true for sentences 8.(9) and 8.(10).
