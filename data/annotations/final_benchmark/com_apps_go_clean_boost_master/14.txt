We have to establish a legal ground to use your personal data, so we will make sure that we only use your personal data for the purposes set out in this Section 4 where we are satisfied that:
our use of your personal data is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (e.g. to fulfill obligations under the contract signed between you and us), or

our use of your personal data is necessary to support ‘legitimate interests’ that we have as a business (for example, to improve our products, or to carry out analytics across our datasets), provided it is always carried out in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights.
In order for us to provide you with our services when you use certain applications, we may collect special categories of data from you. For our collection or use of your special categories of data, we will establish an additional lawful ground to those set out above which will allow us to use that information.

PLEASE NOTE: If we have previously advised that we are relying on consent as the basis of our processing activities, going forward we will not be relying on that legal basis except where this has been explicitly set out to you. For the types information you’ve consented to provide us while using our product or service, you’re deemed to have granted us authorization to continuously use such information throughout the period you use our product or service- unless you have deleted such information (either by yourself or by informing us, pursuant to this Privacy Policy) or, by effective settings or notice, refused our continued usage of the information. When you cancel your user account and / or completely uninstall our product (or stop using our service), we will, pursuant to applicable laws and according to this Policy, stop using and / or delete such information of you.
PLEASE NOTE: If you provide your explicit consent to allow us to process your special categories of data, you may withdraw your consent to such processing at any time. However, you should be aware that if you choose to do so we may be unable to continue to provide certain services to you. If you choose to withdraw your consent we will tell you more about the possible consequences.
PLEASE NOTE: We will not need to, or will be effectively unable to, get your prior consent on collecting and / or using your personal data in the following circumstances, so far as these exemptions are allowed under applicable laws and so far as the collection and usage is necessary for such purposes:
when the collection and usage is related to national secure or national defense, public safety, public health or significant public interests;
when the collection and usage is related to investigation, prosecution, trial or judgment enforcement of criminal acts;
for the sake of life, property or other major legitimate interests of you or others, while in such incidents we have difficulty to reach you to confirm your consent;
when the information we collect has been voluntarily disclosed by yourself;
when we collect your information from sources that have made legitimate and public relevant disclosures of such information, such as legitimate news reports, or governmental information disclosure;
when relevant collection or usage is necessary for ensuring the safe, stable and legitimate operations of our product and service, such as when we need to diagnose or deal with failure or defects in our product and service;

when the collection or usage is necessary for academic or research institutes to make statistical or academy research for public interests, and when such results of research are being disclosed, the personal data contained has been made to be “de-identified”;
when the collection or usage of your information is permitted by applicable laws and regulations for other reasons.
