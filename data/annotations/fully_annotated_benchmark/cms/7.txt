How long we keep data and how we access it

CMS websites keep data collected long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected. The data generated from these activities falls under the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule (GRS) 20-item IC “Electronic Records,” and will be handled according to the requirements of that schedule ( https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html ).
