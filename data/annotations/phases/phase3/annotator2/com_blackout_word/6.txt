2.1 We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this privacy policy are as follows:

(a) our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of service of our apps); or (b) you have provided us with your consent to do so. This applies in relation to the advertising and marketing materials delivered via our apps that are tailored to you and your preferences. You can control and withdraw your consent at any time on our apps. (c) where (a) or (b) does not apply, our use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Our legitimate interests are to: (i) run, grow and develop our business (as well as the businesses of our group companies) including funding our business by use of advertising revenues; (ii) and operate, maintain and improve our apps and our marketing optimisation efforts;
If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at section 10.
