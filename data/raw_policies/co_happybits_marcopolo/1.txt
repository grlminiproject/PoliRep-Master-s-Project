Privacy Principles

Joya has two fundamental principles when it comes to personal information:
We don't sell your personal information or use it to show you ads.
We only store the personal information that we need to function as a video chat and messaging service so you can communicate with the people you choose.
This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Service. By visiting the Marco Polo App or Website and/or using the Service, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.
So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including their name, mobile number, or email address.
