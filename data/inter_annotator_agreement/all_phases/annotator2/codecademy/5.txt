Legal basis for processing in the EU

In the EU, the purposes for which we process your personal data are:
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you for the Service;
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; and
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation in the EU.
We have set out in the table at Annex 1 a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. Please contact by submitting a ticket through our Help Center if you need details about the specific legal basis we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one legal basis has been set out.
