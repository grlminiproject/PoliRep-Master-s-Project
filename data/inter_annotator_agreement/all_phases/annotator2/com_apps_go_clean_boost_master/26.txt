Objection

You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis (see Section 4 or contact us for further details), if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights.
