2.3 Permissions on you device

In providing our product’s functions and services, we may need you to allow certain “permissions” on your device, which will enable to information collection and usage relevant to those functions. These include the permissions described in the list below (please take note that we may revise and update this list from time to time, for the reasons such as update or revision of our product, technology upgrading such as changes in your phone’s operating system, or legal and policy requirements. Such changes will be posted in our updated Privacy Policy):
You can check if such permissions are allowed or not for our product and service, which can be done by checking “Settings – Apps” and / or “Settings – Permissions” in your device, and thereby decide whether each permission will continue to be allowed or will be denied. The specific way to review the status of such permissions and deny them may vary in different devices, and please refer to the notes or instructions provided by relevant device OEMs and OS developers. In case that you’re unable to carry out relevant steps and adjust the settings in your currently-used product or device, please contact us or the OEM of you device.
Please note that allowing these permissions will be deemed as your consent to allow us collect and use relevant information to realize relevant functions; when you deny or disable the permissions in whole or in part, it means you have refused to provide related information to us, therefore also making us unable to provide you those functions relevant to such permissions. To the extent allowed by applicable laws, your decision to deny a certain permission on your device does not affect or invalidate our previous handling of your relevant information which has been based on your prior consent to allow such permission.
