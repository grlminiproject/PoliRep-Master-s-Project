2. Polo Messages and Scrapbooks

Marco Polo is a cloud service. We may collect and store the content you create, including videos (or "Polos"), photos, short video clips you share with selected contacts (or "Scrapbook moments"), and text messages. We store this Personal Information on our servers so that you can access your data anytime from any of your devices that have the Marco Polo App without having to rely on third-party backups or use up your phone’s memory. Our servers are located in the United States.
You may choose to provide us with your friends' contact information as stored on your phone. Marco Polo uses mobile phone numbers and email addresses as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to find and communicate with other people you know. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts, and you can still use the app without giving it access to your contacts (though you will have a harder time finding people you know who also use Marco Polo).
We store your contacts on our servers in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts creates a Marco Polo Account and to properly display their names. We store their name, phone number(s), email address(es), and/or birth day and month for this to work.
Our automatic algorithms also use this data to suggest which of your contacts you might like to communicate with on Marco Polo. We use this information to suggest people to invite to join Marco Polo but we do not contact anyone in your phone’s contact list without your permission. Other than our Service Providers that we describe below, we do not share your contacts with third parties unless required to do so in response to valid legal requests, such as through a court order or search warrant.
