6. Direct marketing

We may use your personal data to send you direct marketing communications about our own or third party products and services or our related services including our latest product announcements and upcoming events. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements. We limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we think will be interesting and relevant to you, based on the information we have about you.
For the purposes of GDPR our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests (as further detailed in applicable Appendix), but where opt-in consent is required by the relevant laws such as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations of Europe, we may ask you for your consent. You have a right to stop receiving direct marketing at any time. You can do this by following the opt-out or unsubscribe links in electronic communications (such as emails), or by contacting us using the details in Section 12 if you find problems in making such settings by yourself. Please also note that, when necessary (e.g., certain service is suspended due to system maintenance), we may send to you relevant announcements. You may not be able to cancel the announcements related to the services that are not promotional in nature.
We also use your personal data for customizing or personalizing ads, offers and content made available to you based on your usage of our mobile applications, websites, platforms or services, and analyzing the performance of those ads, offers and content, as well as your interaction with them. We may also recommend content to you based on information we have collected about you and your viewing habits. This constitutes “profiling” in respect of which more information is provided at Section 8 of this Policy.
