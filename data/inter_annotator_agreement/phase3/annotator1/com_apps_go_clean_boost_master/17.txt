7. International transfers

We may transfer your personal data to Hawk’s affiliate companies or service providers that are located inside or outside of Europe. We may also share your personal data overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection; and
transfers to Hawk’s affiliate companies, service providers and other third parties will always be protected by contractual commitments for additional security. For example, the EU–US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred to the US.
You have the right – as allowed under applicable law – to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. Contact us as set out in Section 12 if you would like further information (which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).
